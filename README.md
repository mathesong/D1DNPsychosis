This is the repository containing the analysis code used for our article *D1-Dopamine Receptor Availability in First-Episode Neuroleptic Naive Psychosis Patients*: Stenkrona P., Matheson G.J., Halldin C., Cervenka S., Farde L.

Some of the data is considered sensitive, and it will not be possible for it to be shared openly due to regulatory restrictions. We are currently in discussions with the institution to ask whether the current interpretation of the regulation can or will be changed. Based on the results of these discussions, more data may be shared at a future point in time. The raw data which *is* considered to be sensitive is available upon request from the authors.
